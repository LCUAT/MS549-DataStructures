# What are the differences in performance?
- The insertion sort showed significant better results. 
# Why are there differences in performance and what is their cause?
- The number of iterations. Even over the smaller lists (100, 1000) the selection sort had to iterate over everything more
# In what cases would each algorithm be preferable?
- Based off these results I would take the insertion sort over the selction in any senario. 
- However if I had some insite into what the data was and I knew it was mostly sorted already then I would use the selection sort
