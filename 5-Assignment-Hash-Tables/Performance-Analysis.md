# What are the differences in performance?
- The larger the number of elements, the slower the time for the most part, but the searh time was pretty constant
# Why are there differences in performance and what is their cause?
- There does seem to be a corelation between the number of conflicts and time increases
# In what cases would each structure or methodology be preferable?
- Linear probing would be best for a smaller fixed sized table 
- Quadratic probling would be best for the larger tables, but is computaionally heavier
- Double hashing works better for smaller tables but has a high computational cost for bigger lists
