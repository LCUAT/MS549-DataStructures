# Algorithm Analysis

- What computational resources does your algorithm/code use?

        This program needs relaively low computation untill the number gets above 30.

- What computational resources impact the performance of your algorithm?

        This algorthim does not have good performance for higher numbers.

- In what cases, situations, or scenarios would your algorithms performance be enhanced or diminished?

        Low numbers the time is negligable. 

- Show the lines or sections of code that would be affected and explain why.

        Lines 1-12 are affected if the number is adjusted.

- Determine and report the Big O of your algorithm. You may want to report the Big O for the best case, worst case, and average case.

        BigO value: O(2^n)
        Best Case: 1.600012183189392e-05s
        Worst Case: 104.42853229981847s

- Profiler - Use a profiler to analyze your code. Describe what you learned about the execution, resources, and efficiency of your code.

        The lower the iterations the less process time.

- Runtime analysis (adding timers around sections of your code) - Conduct a runtime analysis of your code and report the results.

        The results are contained the the RunResults_#.md files. The program ran in a reasonable time for less than 30, anything above that took an exponentially long time.
