# Phase-3-Performance-Analysis

How does the performance change as the number of nodes changes?
- The performance for the transverse got worse, but most everything else stayed reasonably constant

Why are there differences in performance and what is their cause?
- The binary tree is sorted on add so the search and remove functions are still realatively quick. 


In what cases would each structure be preferable?
- When you are going to be running many searches and few add/delete functions this would be more ideal.
