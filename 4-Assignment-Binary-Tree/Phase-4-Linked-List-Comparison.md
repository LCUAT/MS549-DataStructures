# Phase 4 - Linked List Comparison

How does the performance of these two data structures compare with these two functions? 
- Linked lists can insert and remove much faster than a binary tree, but the binary tree can search must faster. 

Are there any special cases that would affect this?
- If the linked list was sorted as it was created then this would change the results
